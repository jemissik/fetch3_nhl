Welcome to FETCH3.14's documentation!
==================================

********
Overview
********

FETCH3.14 is a tree hydrodynamic model for water fluxes across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. FETCH3.14 simulates water
transport through the soil, roots, and xylem as flow through porous media. The model resolves water potentials along the
vertical dimension, and stomatal response is linked to xylem water potential.


There are 2 different transpiration schemes available:

- **Penman-Monteith transpiration(PM)** - Simple transpiration scheme used in *Silva et al, 2022*. Transpiration is
  calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation and disctributed through the canopy based on the leaf area density.
  Stomatal conductance is adjusted using Jarvis functions for incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, vapor
  pressure deficit, and xylem water potential.
- **Non-hydraulically limited transpiration (NHL)** - Replicates the more complex canopy transpiration scheme that was
  used in FETCH2 (*Mirfenderesgi et al, 2016*). Non-hydraulically limited transpiration is calculated considering
  stomatal conductance as a function of atmospheric demand and photosynthetic capacity, but without any limitations
  imposed by soil moisture. The non-hydraulically limited transpiration is then reduced using a function of xylem water
  potential. This scheme considers the different aerodynamic characteristics at different layers in the canopy, and
  radiation attenuation through the canopy.

To start using the model, see the :ref:`Getting Started` page!
